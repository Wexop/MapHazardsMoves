Static enemy are boring, so make them walk !

Turrets, landmines and spike traps can now move to make them more dangerous !

You can config the distance, the delay between each movement, and which map hazard is affected

**Note that only the host configuration is taken !**

For any suggestion or issue feel free to open an issue on [the github project](https://github.com/Wexop/MapHazardsMoves) !
